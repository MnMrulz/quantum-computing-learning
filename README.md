# Quantum Circuits and Algorithms

This repository is a fork of the original Qiskit101 learning repository.

It was developed as part of a collaborative learning effort where we organised a structured course on quantum computing and built a small quantum community around it.  
The notebooks and codes here represent hands-on explorations of quantum circuits, quantum algorithms, and Qiskit-based simulations carried out during and after the course.
These codes were primarily made by Dr. Himadri Barman, who is the guide of one of my ongoing projects.

This fork preserves the original educational structure while reflecting my own learning, annotations, and experimentation with the code.

# <font color=blue>Quantum Circuits 101</font>
**Introductory course on Quantum Circuits and Quantum Computing using  Python based Qiskit (version >= 1.0) library. Author: Dr Himadri Barman** 

## Generic instruction:
Use a Python interactive notebook (Jupyter, Google Colab, etc.) for coding.

## Installations (from the terminal, use prefix `!` if installing from a notebook)

### Install `qiskit` package:  

`pip install qiskit`

### Additional package installations: 

* `pip install pylatexenc` (for matplotlib graphics) [May need to restart kernel]
* `pip install qiskit-aer`   (for quantum simulator)
* `pip install qiskit-ibm-runtime` (for running on IBM hardware)

*Feel free to comment for doubts, suggestions, and improvements.*
